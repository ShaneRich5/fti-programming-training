# Objective: Practice with sets

1. Create a file called lab.py in this directory.
2. Copy the drink-list dictionary from the previous lab into this one.
3. Using your drink-list dictionary, make all of the values Sets instead of Lists
4. Print all of the ingredient sets
5. If your drink lists don't include White and Black Russians, add them.
6. Print the common ingredients in the Russians.
7. What does a White Russian have that a Black Russian does not?
8. You're having a party tonight and plan on making all of these drinks.  Print a shopping list of the unique ingredients you'll need.  (for now, you'll do this in a very inefficient, tedious way: make an explicit request for the ingredients for each of your drinks, and concatenate those together)
