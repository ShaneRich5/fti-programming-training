1. Create a while loop that takes an input of how many miles your car has traveled.
2. Create a counter that starts at 1 and has a step of 1,000.  Continue with the loop until you've traveled 200k miles.
3. Every 10k miles, print "Still driving... at ##,### miles" (make sure the mileage is formatted properly - write a function that does this)
4. When the loop is finished, print "...and Stop!  You're at 200,000 miles!"
