1. Create a file called lab.py in this directory
2. Create a dictionary called "drinks" whose keys are names of common cocktails.  The values will be sets/lists of the ingredients that comprise the drink.
3. Print the drink called a manhattan.
4. Create a list containing all of the drink names.
5. Create a list containing all of the ingredients lists.
6. Is there a margarita in your list?  If so, return its ingredients.  If not, return 'I don't know how to make that!' (use the get method)
