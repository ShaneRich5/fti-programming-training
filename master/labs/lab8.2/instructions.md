1. Copy the files from the previous lab.
2. Add a static attribute named "wheels" to the Vehicle class and set it equal to 0.
3. Create classes for "Car" and "Motorcycle" and inherit the abstract Vehicle class.
4. Set each car's wheels attribute to 4, and motorcycle's wheels to 2.  
*(hint: don't forget to import the Vehicle class into the new classes)*
5. In "lab.py", instead of vehicles create one car and one motorcycle and print out the wheels property.
