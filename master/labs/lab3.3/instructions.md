1. Use the raw_input() function to prompt users for a number between 70 and 100.  
    For now, assume they will input a number and store it as an int.  
    However, make sure your script confirms the value is within the proper range.
2. Iterate over a range that counts from 10 to the number provided.  The iterator should increase by the integer
returned when dividing the number by 5.
3. If the number is a multiple of 7, tell the user, and then exit from the loop.
4. If you never find a multiple, print the highest number achieved in the range.
5. Print the number of iterations completed
