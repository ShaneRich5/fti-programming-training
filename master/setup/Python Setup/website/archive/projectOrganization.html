<h5>Organizing Python Projects</h5>
<p>
  At this point, you have Python and PyCharm installed and pointed them to the virtual environment. Now let's discuss how to organize Python projects. We recommend maintaining a single folder wherein each subfolder corresponds to an independent project. Within a given project folder, all its contents should only pertain to that project. Other best practices are to seperate data files from source code with a subdirectory for your data. If you begin developing a large script or program, you can also compartmentalize code into several files instead of one large, unruly file. In general, you want to think of your scripts and programs as an assembly of modular components then oganize your project folder and code accordingly. Also, try to avoid naming files with spaces. Consider the following folder as an example:
  <pre>
ProjectFolder/
|    main_script.py
|____data/
|        some_data.txt
|        some_more_data.xlsx
  </pre>
</p>
