<h5>Create a Conda Environment</h5>
<p>
  Miniconda's secret sauce is defined by two things: its dependency management and its concept of virtual environments. Python heavily relies on the use of third-party packages developed by its massive community. The drawback of such amazing support is a tendency to run into version conflicts. Conda creates an abstraction such that you only need to tell the manager which packages you want, and it will determine the best versions to install for your system. The user can be as vague or as specific as he or she wants.

  Virtual environments are isolated instances of Python and its dependencies. Conda makes it trivial to create one. All you have to do is point to the correct instance. It is generally good practice to keep your projects isolated from each other. Each project has a different set of dependencies and ultimately a different purpose. Conda environments are also easily exportable. As such, one consultant could create a development environment for a project. Then they can send an <i>exact</i> copy of that environment to another consultant who can pick up development without any further set up beyond activating said environment.

  In fact, the development team behind this tutorial created a conda environment distributed as a BATCH file. All you have to do is run the BATCH program to create the virtual environment. We included a lot of common packages that are useful for typical Python workflows. While it is probably sufficient to only work off of this environment, we encourage you to try creating your own conda environments for other projects. Further documentation on managing conda can be found <a href="https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html" target="_self">here</a>. For now, you only need to double click the <code>pdt-env.bat</code> file.
