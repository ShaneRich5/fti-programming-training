# Objective: Use more Python string methods. 
Print "I'm doing nothing today. I think it is annoying." using functions on the variables
defined in lab.py. 

Tip: If it is tedious finding a word to slice, try embedding the "find" method.  
Another Tip: Is there an easier way to slice from the end of the string?
