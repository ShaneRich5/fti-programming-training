1. Refer to your party planning from the dictionary and sets examples.
2. Re-write the part of your code that generates the grocery set.  instead of explicity calling each drink, use "for" to iterate through your dictionary and build a new set or list.
3. Write additional code that will perform the following:
    
    For each drink in your list, print "Ingredients to make a [drinkname]:", followed by each ingredient printed separately.  
    e.g.
    ```shell
    Ingredients to make a Margarita:
    Tequila
    Lime
    Triple Sec
    ```
