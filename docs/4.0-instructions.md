1) Define a function that will calculate a player's total points, given the number of 3-pointers, 2-pointers, and free-throws that he or she made
    1. Print the player's score with 6 threes, 5 field goals, and 5 free throws
    2. Print the player's score with 0 threes, 2 field goals, and 2 free throws
    3. Print the player's score with 2 threes, 8 field goals, and 7 free throws


2) Define a function that takes in the parameter n and prints out a "staircase" of asterisks with n stairs.
    For example:
    ```python
    staircase(4)
    ```
    should print out

    ```shell
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    ```
    and
    ```python
    staircase(1)
    ```
    should print out
    ```shell
    *
    ```
    Print staircases with 0, 1, and 8 steps
