**Check out the csv module built into Python: https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html**
1. Use the csv module to read through acadamy_awards.csv (in this directory) and loop through each line
2. Create a directory for each Category (the second column of the csv). Whenever you are looping through a row with a category that doesn't have an associated directory, create the directory
3. Create a csv file in each directory for each year
4. Write a row into the csv file that matches the category and year
5. The end result should be a directory for each category, each with a csv file for each year going back to 1927
6. Each file should contain the nominees (and winner) for that category/year
7. Try to use as few lines of code as possible. Good luck
